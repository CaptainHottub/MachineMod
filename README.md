# MachineMod
GitHub repository for my WIP Machine Mod for Minecraft 1.18.1

This is really a mod with blocks I want added to minecraft.


Some inspiration of the blocks and items come from the WASD Machine datapack. The Datapack is made by the WASD build team. Link to the datapack: https://wasdbuildteam.website/data-packs/machines/


Mod is currently version 1. The only block that works is the sprinkler. Everything else has no use right now.
